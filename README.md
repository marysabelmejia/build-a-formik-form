<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

While learning to work with React and Formik, we were tasked with creating a form that took an email and password with conditions, alerted of errors, and notified the user of a successful submission.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Our instructions were as follows: 
* Download the project starter files (I have uploaded these files to the repository).
* Open a terminal window on your computer and run the command cd path/to/project/root (modifying it to the actual source of the files).
  * Run npm install to install all dependencies.
  * Run npm start to start the application in your browser.
  * Once you do this and the browser loads, you should see the form.
    *Start typing in an email, the alert "Username should be an email" will remain until you type in the "@..." part of the email.
    *Empty fields will alert "Field Required".
    *Once both are completed, hit submit, and a notification will pop up stating "Login Successful".
